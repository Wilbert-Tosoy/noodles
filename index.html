                        The word “pancit” colloquially refers to noodles and noodle dishes. The actual word may have
                        beenderived from a Chinese phrase that sounds phonetically similar, which means “to cook
                        conveniently.” Like many Asian countries, the Philippines has a vast and proud noodle culture,
                        and there are dozens upon dozens of noodle dishes served throughout the country.

                        The most common noodle dish found in Filipino homes and restaurants. This dish has egg
                        noodles that are stir fried usually with vegetables like carrots, green beans, shitake
                        mushrooms and cabbage, together with slices of pork. Sometimes, pork liver and sliced fish
                        balls are added too. The combination is usually seasoned with soy sauce or oyster sauce or a
                        combination of both, while some calamansi is served on top for the diner to season to their
                        liking.

                        This rice noodle dish is distinct for its rich, thick sauce flavored with shrimp and tinted
                        with atsuete (annatto seeds). The noodles are then topped with steamed shrimp, spring
                        onions, crisp fried pieces of smoked milkfish and crushed chicharon (fried pork rinds).
                        Again, calamansi is served on top, for the diner to season the dish.

                        From the Chinese phrase meaning “braised noodles”, lomi has thick egg noodles (almost like
                        Japanese udon but with egg) and is braised in a thick soup with carrots, cabbage and
                        mushrooms, usually with slices of pork, shrimp, kikiam (pork and taro wrapped in tofu skin).
                        Some varieties have egg mixed into the thick soup as well. The province of Batangas is a
                        famous destination for their Batangas Lomi.

                        This is the crown jewel of Iloilo cuisine. Egg noodles are served in a flavorful broth made
                        from pork and beef, served with fried pork skin, braised pork meat, liver, and intestine plus
                        beef bone marrow. Fried minced garlic is also added right before serving.
