                    <h3>Pancit Canton</h3>
                    <p>
                        <p>
                            The most often consumed noodle dish in Filipino households and restaurants. This meal has egg noodles stir-fried with vegetables like as carrots, green beans, shitake mushrooms, and cabbage, as well as pieces of pork.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Pork liver and sliced fish balls are occasionally added. The dish is typically seasoned with soy sauce, oyster sauce, or a mixture of the two, with calamansi put on top for the diner to season as desired.
                        </p>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Pancit Palabok/Luglog</h3>
                    <p>
                        <p>
                            The rich, viscous sauce seasoned with shrimp and colored with atsuete(annatto seeds)Â distinguishes this rice noodle dish.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Steamed shrimp, spring onions, crisp fried chunks of smoked milkfish, and crumbled chicharon(fried pork rinds) are then added to the noodles . Calamansi is again put on top for the diner to season the meal.
                        </p>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Lomi</h3>
                    <p>
                        <p>
                            Known as "braised noodles" in Chinese, lomi features thick egg noodles (similar to Japanese udon but with egg) and is braised in a thick broth with carrots, cabbage, and mushrooms, generally with pieces of pork, shrimp, kikiam(pork and taro wrapped in tofu skin), and other vegetables.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some variants include an egg in the thick soup. The province of Batangas is well-known for its Batangas Lomi.
                        </p>
                    </p>

                    <h3>La Paz Batchoy</h3>
                    <p>
                        <p>
                            This is the crowning achievement of Iloilo cuisine. Egg noodles are served with fried pork skin, braised hog flesh, liver and intestine, and cattle bone marrow in a delicious broth prepared from pork and beef. Just before serving, fried minced garlic is also added.
                        </p>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Albondingas (Misua Meatball Soup)</h3>
                    <p>
                        <p>
                            While pancit is influenced by Chinese cuisine, creative Filipinos mixed misua (angel hair flour noodles) with the Spanish dish albondigas (meaning meatballs) to create this Filipino delicacy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Misua noodles are cooked with pig meatballs in a broth. Meanwhile, a shrimp and patola (sponge gourd or loofah) variation is popular in Filipino families, especially during the rainy season.
                        </p> 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Mami</h3>
                    <p>
                        <p>
                            The name is derived from a Chinese term that means "pork noodles," however variants of this dish are typically made with beef or chicken.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Egg (or flour) noodles are served with a savory broth prepared from beef or chicken bones, as well as napa cabbage pieces, hardboiled egg, and shredded chicken or beef. Some varieties include wontons.
                        </p>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Pancit Habhab</h3>
                    <p>
                        <p>
                            Stir-fried egg noodles with pork, carrots, cabbage, and chayote, seasoned with soy sauce and/or oyster sauce. Unlike pancit canton, these noodles should be seasoned with vinegar rather than calamansi.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is generally served without utensils on a banana leaf. Simply place the banana leaf packaging in your mouth and suck the noodles!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you want to enjoy true pancit habhab, you need go to Lucban, Quezon, where it originated and is produced from scratch.
                        </p>
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Pancit Choco En Su Tinta</h3>
                    <p>
                        <p>
                            A traditional Cavite dish also known as "Pancit Pusit." Unlike any other Filipino noodle meal, the rice noodles are cooked with squid and squid ink, giving the noodles a stunning black hue.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It has cabbage, carrots, chiles, kinchay (Chinese celery), and chicharon on top. When kamias fruit (bimbing) is in season, it is added to the noodles to give them a spicy taste.
                        </p>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Kinalas</h3>
                    <p>
                        <p>
                            Almost like a beef mami, the egg noodles in this form, which is predominantly found in the Bicol area, are served with a rich beef broth created from braising sections of the cow head until soft or coming off the bone, as the name indicates.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is typically served with a hard-boiled egg and a strange, enigmatic brown sauce, the recipe and components of which are kept secret by most sellers.
                        </p>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Pancit Henoy</h3>
                    <p>
                        <p>
                            This Cavite noodle dish, named "Henoy" after national hero General Emilio Aguinaldo, is considered to be his favorite. In a soup containing shrimp, calf livers, white and napa cabbage, patola, and glutinous rice flour, egg and rice noodles are cooked.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While it is wonderful, it may be tough to find because restaurants seldom serve it.
                        </p>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Pancit Batil Patung</h3>
                    <p>
                        <p>
                            The somewhat thicker egg noodles in this dish, a delicacy of Northern Luzon areas like Tuguegarao, are customarily stir-fried with minced carabeef (buffalo meat), beansprouts, and spring onions. Most variations include a fried or poached egg on top.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the side is a rich brown sauce with a beaten egg, which is then poured over the noodles. The noodles are then seasoned with a mixture of chopped onions, soy sauce, vinegar, calamansi, and chilies.
                        </p>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Pancit Puso</h3>
                    <p>
                        <p>
                            Pancit Puso is another Cavite noodle dish. A blend of egg and rice noodles is cooked with atsuete-colored pork pieces, cabbage, carrots, and green beans. The banana blossoms are then simmered in vinegar and added to the meal, imparting a bright, zesty taste to the noodles while also providing another textural aspect.
