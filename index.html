                        The word “pancit” colloquially refers to noodles and noodle dishes. The actual word may have
                        beenderived from a Chinese phrase that sounds phonetically similar, which means “to cook
                        conveniently.” Like many Asian countries, the Philippines has a vast and proud noodle culture,
                        and there are dozens upon dozens of noodle dishes served throughout the country.

                        This rice noodle dish is distinct for its rich, thick sauce flavored with shrimp and tinted
                        with atsuete (annatto seeds). The noodles are then topped with steamed shrimp, spring
                        onions, crisp fried pieces of smoked milkfish and crushed chicharon (fried pork rinds).
                        Again, calamansi is served on top, for the diner to season the dish.

                    <p>
                        From the Chinese phrase meaning “braised noodles”, lomi has thick egg noodles (almost like
                        Japanese udon but with egg) and is braised in a thick soup with carrots, cabbage and
                        mushrooms, usually with slices of pork, shrimp, kikiam (pork and taro wrapped in tofu skin).
                        Some varieties have egg mixed into the thick soup as well. The province of Batangas is a
                        famous destination for their Batangas Lomi.

                        This is the crown jewel of Iloilo cuisine. Egg noodles are served in a flavorful broth made
                        from pork and beef, served with fried pork skin, braised pork meat, liver, and intestine plus
                        beef bone marrow. Fried minced garlic is also added right before serving.

                        While pancit is of Chinese influence, the ingenious Filipinos combined misua (angel hair flour
                        noodles) with the Spanish dish albondigas (meaning meatballs) to make this Filipino dish.
                        Misua noodles are cooked in a broth with pork meatballs. Meanwhile, a version of this with
                        shrimp and patola (sponge gourd or loofah) is served commonly in Filipino households, especially
                        during the rainy season.

                        The name is drawn from a Chinese phrase meaning “pork noodles,” but ironically, versions of this
                        dish are mostly made with beef or chicken. Egg (or sometimes flour) noodles are served with a
                        flavorful broth made from beef or chicken bones, together with slices of napa cabbage,
                        hardboiled egg and shredded chicken or beef. Some variations also add wontons.

                        Egg noodles are stir-fried with pork, carrots, cabbage and chayote and flavored with soy sauce
                        and/or oyster sauce. Unlike the pancit canton, it is recommended to season these noodles with
                        vinegar instead of calamansi. This is traditionally served on a banana leaf, without utensils.
                        Just bring the banana leaf package up to your mouth and slurp the noodles! If you want an
                        authentic pancit habhab eating experience, then you should go to Lucban, Quezon where it
                        originated and are made from scratch.

                        A classic Cavite dish also called “Pancit Pusit”. The rice noodles are cooked with squid and
                        squid ink together, giving the noodles a beautiful black color, unlike any other Filipino noodle
                        dish. It’s topped with cabbage, carrots, chili, kinchay (Chinese celery) and chicharon. When
                        it’s in season, kamias fruit (bimbing) is added to give a zesty flavor to the noodles.

                        Almost like a beef mami, this version mostly found in the Bicol region has the egg noodles
                        served with a flavorful beef broth made from braising parts of the beef head until deliciously
                        tender or falling off the bone as the name suggests. It is usually served with a hard boiled egg
                        and a mysterious, enigmatic brown sauce, whose recipe and ingredients most vendors keep secret.

                        Named “Henoy” after national hero General Emilio Aguinaldo, this noodle dish from Cavite is said
                        to be his favorite. A combination of egg and rice noodles are cooked in broth with shrimps, calf
                        livers, white and napa cabbage, patola and thickened with glutinous rice flour. While it is
                        delicious, it may also be difficult to find as restaurants very seldom serve this variety.

                        A specialty of the Northern Luzon provinces like Tuguegarao, the slightly thicker egg noodles in
                        this dish are traditionally stir-fried with minced carabeef (buffalo meat), beansprouts and
                        spring onions. Most versions serve either a fried or poached egg on top. A thick brown sauce
                        with a beaten egg is served on the side, which is then poured onto the noodles. Then, the diner
                        also gets a combination of chopped onions, soy sauce, vinegar, calamansi and chillies to season
                        the noodles even more.

                        Another Cavite noodle dish is Pancit Puso. A combination of egg and rice noodles are cooked with
                        slices of pork, cabbage, carrots and green beans, tinted with atsuete. Then, banana blossoms are
                        braised in vinegar and added to the dish, giving the noodles a bright, zesty flavor, while
                        adding another texture element.
